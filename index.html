						</header>
						<p>I'm the caffeinated Japanese lady who runs I Love Coffee. This site is full of infographics, facts, quizzes, and other fun visual stuff about coffee. When I get bored of writing about coffee, I write about sushi sometimes.
								<br /><br />
							I never liked coffee up until I moved to Seattle in 2009. In fact, I only had maybe literally a couple of coffee in my life till then. I started thinking I should take more advantage of being in Seattle â€” the coffee capital and I trained myself to drink coffee. Now I think my body is made of coffee!
								<br /><br />
								I was in the education field for a decade, and I started this site as a hobby. Now I dumped my education career and I'm full time on this!  I get to do this for a living because of you guys and I really hope you like coffee more than before after reading this please visit my <a href="http://en.ilovecoffee.jp/" >website.</a>

							<h2>My Story</h2>
							<p class="info">a story of <a href="#">Mine</a></p>
						</header>
						<p>So now that you know why most people on the planet are addicted to coffee. It is time for my story. My first time trying coffee was when my uncle gave me some at his house. <br /><br /> First sip was so bad i got traumatized by it immediatetly.That was when i was a 7 years old kid. I grew up in the carribean which people normally don't drink that much coffe in the first place and secondly my parent are chinese, so i didn't got the chance try coffee again. <br /><br />Everything change when i came to The Netherlands. The Netherlands is one of the top coffee drinking countries in the world as explained by the video of CGP Grey. I started drinking coffee because people around are, but also because i need the cafeine to keep me awake for my study here. Then there is where everything started.</p>
