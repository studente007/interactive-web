    Latte Macchiato is a lot like a caffe latte, since it is made from a lot of hot milk at the bottom and a small amount of espresso added on top. This coffee drink is very popular in Germany where it is the coffee of choice in most coffee shops. The mix of ingredients in this drink makes it ideal for serving up in a tall glass, with the ingredients layered beautifully. The layering can be a bit tricky at first but if you pour with ease it’s perfectly possible.

  Latte Macchiato translates into something like “milk with marks” and depending on where in the world you order it, the milk/coffee ratio differs, some baristas literally just add a couple of coffee marks on the hot milk while other make it more like a caffe latte with extra milk.

  <h2>Espresso</h2>

  Espresso dates back to Italy in the early 1900’s. It is usually served in a small cup (not unlike a shot). At its most simple, espresso is “just” concentrated coffee and is slightly stronger in taste and aroma, compared to filter coffee.

  To avoid the bitterness in the coffee, some people sweeten their espresso with raw cane sugar or refined sugar, but most of the times espresso is used as an ingredient in other coffee varieties &em; like in the coffee drinks mentioned below (caffe latte, latte macchiato and cappuccino.

  <h2>Cappuccino</h2>

  The Cappuccino was very popular a decade ago, and also originates from Italy (there’s a pattern here, eh?). It is made from 1/3 espresso, 1/3 hot milk and 1/3 foamed milk. Many coffee shops also serve cappuccinos with a drizzle of chocolate or cocoa powder on the top, which some like and some don’t – feel free to find your own favourite.

  If you like to experiment with your servings, the thick layer of foam on a cappuccino is the perfect canvas for making beautiful coffee art, using syrups, sauces, powders, nuts and whatever comes to mind – only your own imagination sets the limits.
