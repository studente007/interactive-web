    </b>
    </P>
    <p>Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels (1, 2).<br /><br />

This is because it contains a stimulant called caffeine, which is actually the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world (3).
<br /><br />
After you drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into the bloodstream. From there, it travels into the brain (4).
<br /><br />
In the brain, caffeine blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter called Adenosine.
<br /><br />
When that happens, the amount of other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine actually increases, leading to enhanced firing of neurons (5, 6).
<br /><br />
Many controlled trials in humans show that coffee improves various aspects of brain function. This includes memory, mood, vigilance, energy levels, reaction times and general cognitive function (7, 8, 9).</p>

    <p margin-left="10px"><b>2. Coffee Can Help You Burn Fat
    </b>
    </P>
    <p>
    Did you know that caffeine is found in almost every commercial fat burning supplement?
<br /><br />
    There’s a good reason for that… caffeine is one of the very few natural substances that have actually been proven to aid fat burning.
<br /><br />
    Several studies show that caffeine can boost the metabolic rate by 3-11% (10, 11).
<br /><br />
    Other studies show that caffeine can specifically increase the burning of fat, by as much as 10% in obese individuals and 29% in lean people (12).
<br /><br />
    However, it is possible that these effects will diminish in long-term coffee drinkers.

    <p margin-left="10px"><b>3. The Caffeine Can Drastically Improve Physical Performance
    </b>
    </P>
    <p>
      Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, causing it to send signals to the fat cells to break down body fat (13, 14).
<br /><br />
      But caffeine also increases Epinephrine (Adrenaline) levels in the blood (15, 16).
<br /><br />
      This is the “fight or flight” hormone, designed to make our bodies ready for intense physical exertion.
<br /><br />
      Caffeine makes the fat cells break down body fat, releasing them into the blood as free fatty acids and making them available as fuel (17, 18).
<br /><br />
      Given these effects, it is not surprising to see that caffeine can improve physical performance by 11-12%, on average (29, 20).
<br /><br />
      Because of this, it makes sense to have a strong cup of coffee about a half an hour before you head to the gym.

    <p margin-left="10px"><b>4. There Are Essential Nutrients in Coffee
    </b>
    </P>
    <p>
Coffee is more than just black water. Many of the nutrients in the coffee beans do make it into the final drink.

A single cup of coffee contains (21):
<br /><br />
 Riboflavin (Vitamin B2): 11% of the RDA.<br />
 Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5): 6% of the RDA.<br />
 Manganese and Potassium: 3% of the RDA.<br />
 Magnesium and Niacin (B3): 2% of the RDA.><br /><br />
Although this may not seem like a big deal, most people are drinking more than one cup per day. If you drink 3-4, then these amounts quickly add up.

    <p margin-left="10px"><b>5. Coffee May Lower Your Risk of Type II Diabetes
    </b>
    </P>
    <p>
      Type 2 diabetes is a gigantic health problem, currently afflicting about 300 million people worldwide.
<br /><br />
      It is characterized by elevated blood sugars in the context of insulin resistance or an inability to secrete insulin.
<br /><br />
      For some reason, coffee drinkers have a significantly reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
<br /><br />
      The studies show that people who drink the most coffee have a 23-50% lower risk of getting this disease, one study showing a reduction as high as 67% (22, 23, 24, 25, 26).
<br /><br />
      According to a massive review that looked at data from 18 studies with a total of 457,922 individuals, each daily cup of coffee was associated with a 7% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes (27).

    <p margin-left="10px"><b>6. Coffee May Protect You From Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia</b>
    </P>
    <p>Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia worldwide.
<br /><br />
This disease usually affects people over 65 years of age.
<br /><br />
Unfortunately, there is no known cure for Alzheimer’s.
<br /><br />
However, there are several things you can do to prevent the disease from showing up in the first place.
<br /><br />
This includes the usual suspects like eating healthy and exercising, but drinking coffee may be incredibly effective as well.
<br /><br />
Several studies show that coffee drinkers have up to a 65% lower risk of getting Alzheimer’s disease (28, 29). </p>

    <p margin-left="10px"><b>7. Caffeine May Lower The Risk of Parkinson's</b>

    </P>
    <p>
      Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, right after Alzheimer’s.
<br /><br />
It is caused by death of dopamine-generating neurons in the brain.
<br /><br />
Same as with Alzheimer’s, there is no known cure, which makes it that much more important to focus on prevention.
<br /><br />
In studies, coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, with a reduction in risk ranging from 32-60% (30, 31, 32, 33).
<br /><br />
In this case, it appears to be the caffeine itself that is causing the effect. People who drink decaf don’t have a lower risk of Parkinson’s (34).
